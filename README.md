[moisture sensor](https://github.com/rjalejandro/misc/tree/main/moisture_sensor): is a simple arduino-based moisture sensor that reads the moisture value from a Velleman VMA303 moisture sensor, it converts it to a porcentage value, and turns ON an "OK moisture" LED if the moisture value is above or equal to 50%, or it turns ON a "LOW moisture" LED if moisture is below 50%. Initially implemented to have a visual reminder of watering my plants.
