## random projects and pieces of code

[moisture sensor](https://github.com/rjalejandro/misc/tree/main/moisture_sensor): is a simple arduino-based moisture sensor that reads the moisture value from a Velleman VMA303 moisture sensor, it converts it to a porcentage value, and turns ON an "OK moisture" LED if the moisture value is above or equal to 50%, or it turns ON a "LOW moisture" LED if moisture is below 50%. Initially implemented to have a visual reminder of watering my plants.

[stimulus detection](https://github.com/rjalejandro/misc/tree/main/stimulus_detection): is an light-dependent resistor (LDR)-based light intensity sensor. It helped me measure that the timing that certain stimuli were on the screen were as they were supposed to be (there were some timing issues with psychopy).
